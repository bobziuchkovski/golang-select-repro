# golang-select-repro
Code to reproduce a golang channel select failure/bug.  The code is stripped down to basically gibberish.

See https://github.com/golang/go/issues/14561 for the bug report.  The code in this repo is a mangled subset
of code that I'll be releasing as open source later, so there's really nothing of interest here unless you're
looking to reproduce the hanging select I reported upstream.
